# Purpose: Marks the data-access package for database queries.
# It primarily establishes package exports, constants, or module-level configuration.
# It isolates SQL and database access from services and route handlers.
# Callers receive focused behavior without duplicating this module's implementation details.
# Keeping this responsibility isolated makes changes easier to test and review.
# Used by: Python imports this package marker while resolving its child modules.
# Consumers normally import the focused modules inside this package directly.
# Tests and higher-level workflows exercise this behavior through its public callers.
